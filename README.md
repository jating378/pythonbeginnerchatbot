# Python Chatbot
This is a Python chatbot project that I developed as part of my coursework from January to April 2022. The chatbot is designed to provide a fully interactive experience and incorporates various functionalities using Python on PyCharm.

Project Highlights
Interactive Chatbot: I developed a chatbot that can engage in conversations with users, responding to their queries and commands.
API Integration: To enhance the chatbot's capabilities, I integrated external APIs and libraries. This allowed the chatbot to provide real-time weather updates, news updates, perform text-to-animation conversion, and offer countdown functionality.
Programming Skills: The project showcases my programming skills in Python, as I leveraged the language to build the chatbot's core functionality and ensure smooth interactions.
Problem-Solving Abilities: Developing an interactive chatbot required me to apply problem-solving techniques, such as handling user inputs, understanding their intent, and generating appropriate responses.
Integration of External Resources: By integrating APIs and libraries, I demonstrated my ability to utilize external resources effectively, expanding the chatbot's functionalities and enriching the user experience.

Usage
To experience the chatbot, you can run the Python script associated with the project. The chatbot will initiate and provide a welcome message. From there, you can interact with it by typing queries or commands, and the chatbot will respond accordingly, showcasing its various features.

Future Development

In the future, I plan to continue improving and expanding the chatbot's capabilities. This may include incorporating additional features, enhancing its natural language understanding, and refining the overall user experience.
